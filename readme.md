# Project 3 - Laravel Basics (Developer's Best Friend)

## Live URL
<http://p3.paulhermany.me>

## Description
This is an app that provides a lorem ipsum text generator and random user generator using the Laravel framework.

The app has a RESTful structure where the URLs to each generator are descriptive and grammatically correct. For example, when requesting a single user, the property should be singular. Conversely, when requesting more than one, the property should be plural.

## Demo
I will provide a demo during the Tuesday virtual section.

## Instructions
